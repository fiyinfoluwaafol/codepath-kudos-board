### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Generally, this week was quite packed with a lot of content, but after reviews I would like to say I felt prepared for this week's project. I can't think of any specifc required feature that I felt unprepared for

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would really focused a lot on styling to be honest. As much as it looks okay now, there is always room for improvement.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think the demo went quite smoothly, but i probably need to look into why the image was always changing whenever something on the page changed

### Open-source libraries used



### Shout out

I would like to give a shout out to Sammy for helping me resolve an issue I had with delete, so he suggested to look into deleting on cascade, so that ensured that I wasn't blocked while working on that feature.
